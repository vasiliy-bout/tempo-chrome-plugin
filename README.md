entered and restores it to the original value saved in the card.

This plugins disables input fields while there are active AJAX requests.

How to install:
* Save all files into a folder.
* Open Google Chrome extensions page.
* Enable "Developer mode"
* Press "Load unpacked" button and choose the folder where you saved the files.
